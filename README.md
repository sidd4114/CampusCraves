## 🌟 Problem Statement

College canteen ordering can be **time-consuming and inefficient**, especially during short breaks:

- ⏱️ 2–15 minutes just placing an order  
- ⏱️ 5–10 minutes waiting for food  
- ⏱️ Additional time searching for a seat  

By the time students receive their food, **the break is nearly over** — leading many to skip the canteen entirely.
