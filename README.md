*Simplifying campus food ordering. Built for students, by students.*

## Problem Statement

In many college canteens, ordering food isn’t as efficient as it should be. With just a 30-minute break, students often waste valuable time:

- 2–15 minutes just placing an order  
- 5–10 minutes waiting for food  
- Additional time searching for a seat  

By the time they’re done, the break is nearly over — and many students skip the canteen altogether, choosing to eat in class instead.
