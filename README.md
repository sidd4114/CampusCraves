# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

In many college canteens, ordering food isn’t as efficient as it should be. With just a 30-minute break, students often waste valuable time:

• 2–15 minutes just placing an order
 • 5–10 minutes waiting for their food
 • Plus, extra time hunting for a seat

By the time they’re done, the break is almost over — and many students end up skipping the canteen altogether, choosing to eat in class instead.

To tackle this everyday issue, we built CampusCraves — our second-year mini-project aimed at simplifying and speeding up campus food ordering.

CampusCraves is a web-based food ordering system designed specifically for college campuses. It allows students to:
• Browse live menus
• Place orders in advance
• Pay instantly via Razorpay

For canteen admins, the system provides a smart dashboard to add and remove menu items, browse and manage orders, track sales and performance — with analytics features coming soon.
